# Against Time - Technical test project

Welcome to this project born from 2 days of work and developed for a technical interview.

In this demo of the game you will drive a racing car through a small circuit where you will hace to beat time by supporting yourself with a certain type of hoops that will help you not to yun out of time.

## About

The objective of this project was to develop a small demo of a racing game where the player would be in charge of driving a kart car through a racing circuit before time runs out. The player would have a type of object along the circuit which would help him add time before it runs out, so it would be of great benefit to collect them as a secondary objective.

The demo would have 2 scenes, a main menu and the game scene where you could navigate and a data storage system, which can be consulted in the main menu scene.

Warning: This is not a final product! This is only my thoughts on the topic.

## Examples

Dou to certain technical problems this section is still in progress, soon I will be uploading content to display.

## Important comments

- Although this project was made for a technical test, this is not the final product. It is intended to continue working on it for the sole purpose of learning and practice. For what in the future it is planned to implement:
	- A better data storage system.
	- Connection with services like Playfab
	- A basic multiplayer system using mirror.

- All art used in this project was used for the sole non-commercial purpose of developing a demo for a technical exam. Part of the art was provided by the company in charge of the application of said test while the origin of the other artistic resources used can be found in the Resources section.

## General Notes

- The code of this project was carried out trying to follow the best principles of cleanliness and quality. Among these, an attempt was made to make use of the greatest amount of good practices said and provided by the Clean code book by Robert C. Martin better known as Uncle Bob.

- An intelligent and well-applied use was made of the SOLID principles as well as some design patterns for the correct abstraction and decoupling of the system and the different modules. Among the design patterns that were used, the use of:
	- Strategy
	- Observer
	- Adapter
	- Facade
	- Mediator
	- ServiceLocator

- The implementation of a car customization system and others are planned in the future, as discussed in the "Important comments" section, so other design patterns such as Factory and builder will be used.

- Due to time constraints and other technical and external complications beyond my control, an adequate decoupled data storage system could not be completed to be able to exchange between different storage systems without affecting the application logic. This will be working in the short term.

- Similarly, due to technical complications, a software architecture for the project could not be structured in a better way. We will be working with the code namespaces and assemblies to try to comply as best as possible with the correct communication and implementation of the Clean Architecture.

## Resources and Assets
